recommendflights
================
Usage:
  Just run recommendflights

You're welcome to add flights to "flights" data set, travelers to "travelers" data set
and explore how the model works by changing factor-* parameters in Personalize().
Also, add to "airlines" if you add new flights and/or airline policy to traveler data.
Also, add to "classes" if you add new classes and/or class policy to traveler data.

Works with Octave 3.4.3.  Not tested with Matlab, but should run with no or minor modifications.
